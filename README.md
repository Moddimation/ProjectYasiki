Supported versions (active):
- `GLMJ01`: Japan (Rev 0)

Supported versions (to be worked on):
- `GLME01`: USA (Rev 0)
- `GLME01_1`: USA Demo (Oct 2001)
- `GLMP01`: Europe (Rev 0)
- `GLMP01_1`: Europe (Rev 1)
- `GLMP01_2`: Europe (Mar 2002)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reminder: **this will not produce a playable game.** 
> This project will not allow you to play the game if you don't provide your own copy.

> [!WARNING]
> This game does *no*t ship with *symbols*, so information is scraped together with *RTTI* and *LM for 3DS* (has a few folder /file names).
> 
> Not recommended for beginners, but noone shall remove your right to advance.

Information
===========
I heavily restructured the source layout of the original repo from [Sage-of-Mirrors](https://github.com/Sage-of-Mirrors/zmansion). This was not forked directly from it, but from [CoNesTra](https://github.com/CoNesTra/zmansion), as he put in effort to add Luigi's Mansion 3DS information to the repo and updated the [DTK](https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit) tools.
I did reset the splits and the symbol list, so the % were brought back to 0.
### Current State of Progress
I was trying to fill out the symbols in the Ghidra repository (read further to learn how to connect to the server),
but decided to start filling out libraries instead, as labelling the symbols also requires filling in struct data etc.
### Code Structure
The code categories are put inside of the 'decomp' folder in root, as follows:  
 `/decomp/<category>/...`
 
Sublibraries in a library rely on the modular scheme used for libraries and for the game, such as:  
 `/decomp/JSystem/System/JKernel/ src/include`,  
 `/decomp/JSystem/System/JSupport/ src/include`,  
 `/decomp/JSystem/JAudio/JAInterface/ src/include`,  
 `/decomp/Project/Kawamoto/  src/include`,  
 `/decomp/Project/Sotoike/  src/include`,  
 `/decomp/Project/Koga/  src/include`,
and so on.

My goal is to stay as original as possible, while still making it possible to work with for the decompiling efforts.
### Configuration Structure
I put every library in configure.py in a helper function according to its category, for a better interface.
### Documents
Iâ€™ve also included some small private notes in `/docs/*.txt`, which may contain useful information (if needed).
### Misc
- You can put personal stuff in /private/, it is ignored with github.
- I prefer communication through [the Discord](https://discord.gg/hKx3FJJgrV) in the #luigis-mansion channel, but you can open issues as needed.
### To-do
Project Code:
- once labelling is done, carry over these to the symbols and splits file.
Project Misc:
- Add workflow for building
- Add progress indicator for displaying
- Maybe a webpage? (why not)

Dependencies
============

Windows:
--------

On Windows, it's **highly recommended** to use native tooling. WSL or msys2 are **not** required.  
When running under WSL, [objdiff](#diffing) is unable to get filesystem notifications for automatic rebuilds.

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and add it to `%PATH%`.
  - Also available from the [Windows Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-311/9NRWMJP3717K).
- Download [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) and add it to `%PATH%`.
  - Quick install via pip: `pip install ninja`

macOS:
------
- Install [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages):
  ```
  brew install ninja
  ```
- Install [wine-crossover](https://github.com/Gcenx/homebrew-wine):
  ```
  brew install --cask --no-quarantine gcenx/wine/wine-crossover
  ```

After OS upgrades, if macOS complains about `Wine Crossover.app` being unverified, you can unquarantine it using:
```sh
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine '/Applications/Wine Crossover.app'
```

Linux:
------
- Install [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages).
- For non-x86(_64) platforms: Install wine from your package manager.
  - For x86(_64), [WiBo](https://github.com/decompals/WiBo), a minimal 32-bit Windows binary wrapper, will be automatically downloaded and used.

Building
========

- Clone the repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Moddimation/Yasiki.git
  ```

- Copy your game's disc image to `orig/<VERSION>`.
  - Supported formats: ISO (GCM), RVZ, WIA, WBFS, CISO, NFS, GCZ, TGC
  - After the initial build, the disc image can be deleted to save space. It is recommended to keep `orig/<VERSION>/sys/main.dol`, though, which is the only file being actually needed. If deleted, you'll need to redownload it if you delete the build/ folder.

- Configure:
  ```
  python configure.py
  ```
  To use a version other than `GLMJ01` (Japan), specify `--version <version`.
  Example usage (See its github for detailed usage):
  - `python configure.py --version GLME01` (US Release).
  - `python configure.py --version GLMP01_2` (EU Release Rev 1)
  - `python configure.py --debug` Build with debug
  - `python configure.py --map` Build and generate map (for comparison)
  - `python configure.py progress` Show progress

- Build:
  ```
  ninja
  ```
- Useful:
  - `ninja diff` When failing to build, check the differences (command line only).
  - `ninja apply` When finished decompiling a file, and marking it as Matching in configure.py, this updates the symbols.txt for correctness.


Diffing
=======

Once the initial build succeeds, an `objdiff.json` should exist in the project root. 

Download the latest release from [encounter/objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff).

Under project settings, set `Project directory` to the root, aka the file containing the `objdiff.json` file. The configuration should be loaded automatically, and if not, ensure that the build generated no errors. If it did, resolve these and try again.

Select an object from the left sidebar to begin diffing. Changes to the project will rebuild automatically: changes to source files, headers, `configure.py`, `splits.txt` or `symbols.txt`.

Setting up Ghidra
=================

Ghidra is a tool that automatically decompiles code. Although Ghidra's output is not accurate enough to be directly copy-pasted into this decompilation project, it can still be helpful for understanding functions and decompiling them faster. You are free to use other decompilation methods, such as IDA, m2c or manually, but ghidra was chosen as the preferred tool in the gamecube/wii decomp scene.

I've got a shared Ghidra project for LuigisMansion already set up, that I usually update. To get access to this server:

* Go to https://ghidra.decomp.dev and link your Discord account.
* Create a Ghidra account by entering a new username and password into the form on the right.
* Request "Read" access to the LuigisMansion server.

Then wait for an admin to approve your request. Once you have access, you can set up the Ghidra project like so:

* To use Ghidra, you first need to install JDK. You can download OpenJDK 17 from [here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).
* Download the RootCubed Ghidra build ghidra_11.4_DEV_20250425 from the link in the `Download section `[here](https://rootcubed.dev/ghidra_builds/).
(*OPTIONAL) If you wish to load/analyze other binaries for gamecube/wii, you need the `Ghidra-GameCube-Loader` extension, which you can get on the RootCubed Ghidra page.
* Launch Ghidra with `ghidraRun`.
* In Ghidra, go to `File -> New Project...`. Select `Shared Project` and input the following information:
    * Server Name: ghidra.decomp.dev
    * Port Number: 13100
    * User ID: (the username that you chose earlier)
    * Password: (the password that you chose earlier)
* You should now be able to view the files in the Ghidra project. You should checkout the `main` file.

Now you have Ghidra set up and ready to use.

For an introduction on how to use Ghidra, you can read [this section of the Twilight Princess decompilation's guide](https://zsrtp.link/contribute/decompiler-setup#using-ghidra).
